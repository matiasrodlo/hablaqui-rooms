# System Architecture Overview

## Introduction

Hablaqui Video Rooms is a secure video conferencing application built for healthcare consultations. This document provides a high-level overview of the system architecture.

## System Components

### Frontend
- **React Application**: Main user interface built with React and TypeScript
- **Twilio Video SDK**: Handles real-time video and audio communication
- **Twilio Conversations**: Manages chat functionality
- **Material-UI**: Provides the component library and styling

### Backend
- **Token Server**: Generates access tokens for Twilio services
- **Express.js**: Handles server-side logic
- **Firebase**: Optional authentication service

### Infrastructure
- **Twilio Programmable Video**: Core video infrastructure
- **Twilio Conversations**: Chat infrastructure
- **Serverless Deployment**: Hosted on Twilio Serverless

## Key Features

### Video Communication
- Real-time video and audio streaming
- Screen sharing capabilities
- Bandwidth management
- Network quality monitoring
- Dominant speaker detection

### Security
- Token-based authentication
- End-to-end encryption
- Secure WebRTC connections
- HIPAA compliance considerations

### User Experience
- Responsive design
- Real-time quality indicators
- Chat functionality
- Recording capabilities

## Data Flow

1. **Authentication Flow**
   ```
   User -> Frontend -> Token Server -> Twilio Services
   ```

2. **Video Communication Flow**
   ```
   User A -> Twilio Video SDK -> Twilio Media Server -> User B
   ```

3. **Chat Flow**
   ```
   User A -> Twilio Conversations -> Twilio Chat Service -> User B
   ```

## Security Architecture

### Authentication
